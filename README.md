## dsa-practice

Concise collection of **data structures and algorithms** implementations, focused on interview-style problems and pattern-based practice.

### What’s inside
- **Problem sets**: Solutions organized by topic (e.g. `arrays`, `sliding_window`, `matrix`, etc.).
- **Python implementations**: Clear, idiomatic Python solutions with comments where helpful.
- **Patterns-focused**: Emphasis on common patterns (sliding window, two pointers, prefix sums, etc.) to build intuition and speed.

### How to use this repo
- **Browse by folder** to study a specific pattern or topic.
- **Run and tweak solutions** to understand how changes affect behavior and performance.
- **Add your own problems/solutions** to extend the practice set as you learn.
